# Special Characters

> Headshot

Some of you might have noticed that in order to define a `String` we put our text within double quotes (`"`). But what if the text itself contains double quotes? Something like `Java is a so-called "object-oriented" language`. Well let's try it:

> Live Coding

```java
class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s = "Java is a so-called "object-oriented" language";
 }
}
```

You can see that the color of the string is all messed up and also we can't run the code because we get a syntax error. That's because Java thinks that the string is ended after `so-called` but it isn't and it caused confusion. In order to mitigate this, we need to add a backslash (`\`) before the double quotes inside our string to "escape" them like so:


```java
class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s = "Java is a so-called \"object oriented\" language";
 }
}
```

Great! Now our code runs without any problem. Double quote is a special character, one that we need to use `\"` to use inside a string. There are other special characters as well. The backslash itself is written by writing two backslashes like `\\` and the newline character is written as `\n`. Let's see it in action:

```java
class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s = "First line\nSecond line\nThird line!";
 System.out.println(s);
 }
}
```

Voila!
